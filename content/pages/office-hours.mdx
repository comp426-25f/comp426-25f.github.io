## How to Get Help

To get help, **create an office hours ticket** on the "Office Hours" tab of the CSXL website.

**Steps:**
1. Log into your account at `csxl.unc.edu`.
2. Navigate to the "My Courses" tab, find COMP 426 on this page.
3. Press "Get Help" and fill out a ticket.
4. Wait until your ticket is called!

Please note that TAs reserve the right to turn you away if you do not create a ticket in the office hours system! Asking for help through this system ensures fairness and that nobody skips the line. Also, there may be limits on the number of tickets you can create in a 24hr period.

If you have questions about course materials or assignments, please see the TAs in office hours! *Please do not email TAs after hours directly unless explicitly told to!*

If you have a question about course logistics (not including assignment help) or would like to make a meeting with me (the instructor), please reach out via email and I would be happy to set up an appointment time with you!
