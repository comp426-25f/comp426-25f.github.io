Hello students - welcome to the **first reading assignment of the semester**! All reading assignments will be posted on the website like this one is. There will also be an accompanying ***GradeScope submission*** for each. Please make sure that you are on the COMP 426 GradeScope. If you are not, *please reach out to Ajay as soon as possible!*

Please read the syllabus, which is located [here](/syllabus). Then, answer the accompanying questions on GradeScope.

You are allowed to have the reading open while completing the GradeScope questions, and these questions are *not* timed in any way. You have unlimited submissions until the deadline, so you are able to start working, take a break, and come back to it (just make sure to save your work).

As noted in the syllabus, we ask that you adhere to the UNC Honor Code while completing reading questions, which means that all writing and answers should be your own work! We ask that you do not use AI tools to think for you - reading assignments are purposefully designed to accompany course material and gives you the opportunity to *think through each question*, which will lead to better mastery of course material and help you when preparing for exams in a low-stakes way (readings are a very low weight of your overall course grade). If you have any questions while completing reading assignments, feel free to come to office hours!
