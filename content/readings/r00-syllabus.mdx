Hello students - welcome to **COMP 426!** ðŸ‘‹

Our first reading assignment will be to read the course syllabus and answer some questions in GradeScope. The syllabus for the course can be found [here](/syllabus).

As part of the assignment, you will also complete an **intro survey**! This will allow the team to learn more about our students, determine prior experience levels, and current workloads.
